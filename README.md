# Web App Template

A basic template for projects that I build.

## Tasks

- Set up and call AI APIs (todo: buffer-vector, chat-formatted-output, chat-template, pinecone, plugin, sequential-chain). Frontend needs types - separate typed useApi or type the response?
- Get a demo database so I can use the basic functionality?
- Make it a GitHub template
- When you hit enter, don't go to new line in textarea (does formik solve this?)

## Todo

- Build common components (modals, buttons, etc)
- Include something for Hasura
- React query?
- Pull description
- Do I want to use an "atoms" folder?
- Is formik the best option for forms or should we consider something like react-hook-form?
